## Overview
Customer segmentation is an essential tool for businesses to:
- Personalize marketing campaigns.
- Improve customer retention.
- Increase profitability.

This project uses **KMeans Clustering** to segment customers based on key metrics:
- **Recency**: Time since last purchase.
- **Frequency**: Number of purchases.
- **Monetary Value**: Total spend.

The segmented data is stored back in a MySQL database for future use and analysis.

---

## Features
- Fetch raw customer data from MySQL.
- Preprocess data (handle missing values, scaling, and feature engineering).
- Apply **KMeans Clustering** to create customer segments.
- Save clusters back to the MySQL database for further analysis.

## Data Pipeline

1. **Data Extraction**: 
   - Raw data is retrieved from a MySQL database.

2. **Preprocessing**: 
   - Convert timestamps to appropriate formats.
   - Handle missing or invalid values.
   - Feature engineering: Calculate Recency, Frequency, and Monetary (RFM) metrics.
   - Scale data for clustering.

3. **Clustering**: 
   - Apply KMeans algorithm to segment customers.

4. **Save Results**: 
   - Add the cluster labels to the database.

## Technologies Used
- **Programming Language**: Python
- **Database**: MySQL
- **Libraries**:
  - `pandas` - Data manipulation
  - `numpy` - Numerical operations
  - `scikit-learn` - Machine learning
  - `mysql-connector-python` - Database connection
  - `matplotlib`, `seaborn` - Visualization
- **Version Control**: Git and GitHub
